abstract: Learning was always an essential part of our lives to acquire knowledge and move forward. However, the increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore, finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic learning approach using two different groups.






# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Molecular docking is one of the favorite tools for assessment of the interactions between a ligand and its congener macromolecule. In silico approaches and especially molecular docking are gaining much attention in recent years due to their cost-effective nature.
